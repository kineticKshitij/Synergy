KEY SUCCESS FACTORS:

1. ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS:
   The choice of Django REST Framework and React Router v7 provided a solid
   foundation for rapid development with built-in security features.

2. PERFORMANCE FOCUS:
   Early emphasis on performance testing and optimization resulted in a
   system capable of handling 250+ concurrent users with sub-200ms responses.

3. SECURITY-FIRST APPROACH:
   Implementing OWASP Top 10 protections from the start ensured a secure
   foundation without retrofitting security later.

4. TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT:
   Maintaining 95%+ test coverage provided confidence in code changes and
   prevented regressions.

5. DOCUMENTATION:
   Comprehensive documentation facilitated onboarding and maintenance.


LESSONS LEARNED:

1. EARLY OPTIMIZATION PAYS OFF:
   Implementing database indexes and caching strategies early prevented
   performance bottlenecks as the application grew.

2. SECURITY CANNOT BE AN AFTERTHOUGHT:
   Building security into the architecture from day one was easier than
   adding it later.

3. TESTING SAVES TIME:
   While writing tests initially took time, it saved countless hours in
   debugging and prevented production issues.

4. DOCKER SIMPLIFIES DEPLOYMENT:
   Containerization made deployment consistent across environments and
   simplified the development setup.

5. API-FIRST DESIGN ENABLES FLEXIBILITY:
   Separating frontend and backend allowed independent development and
   future mobile app integration.
