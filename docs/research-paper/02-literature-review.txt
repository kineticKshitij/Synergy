2.2 Web Application Architecture Patterns
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2.1 Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture
..............................................................................

MONOLITHIC ARCHITECTURE:
- Single deployable unit containing all functionality
- Advantages: Simpler development, easier testing, straightforward deployment
- Disadvantages: Scaling challenges, technology lock-in, deployment risks

Research by Fowler & Lewis (2014) on microservices architecture patterns
identifies key characteristics:
- Componentization via services
- Organized around business capabilities
- Decentralized data management
- Independent deployment

SynergyOS adopts a HYBRID APPROACH:
- Microservices-oriented architecture using Docker containers
- Separate services: database, cache, backend API, frontend, message broker
- Each service can be scaled independently
- Clear separation of concerns without excessive complexity


2.2.2 RESTful API Design
..............................................................................

Roy Fielding's dissertation (2000) established REST architectural style:
- Client-server separation
- Statelessness
- Cacheability
- Uniform interface
- Layered system

SynergyOS implements RESTful principles:
- Django REST Framework for API endpoints
- HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) mapped to CRUD operations
- JSON as primary data interchange format
- Hypermedia (HATEOAS) through serializer relationships
- Versioning capability through URL namespacing


2.2.3 Single-Page Applications (SPA)
..............................................................................

SPA architecture popularized by Gmail (2004) and Facebook (2007+):
- Entire application loaded as single HTML page
- Dynamic updates via AJAX without page reloads
- Improved user experience and responsiveness

React Router v7 (2024) advances SPA capabilities:
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for improved SEO and initial load
- Client-side hydration for interactive functionality
- Route-based code splitting for optimized bundle sizes
- Nested routing with data loading conventions

SynergyOS leverages React Router v7:
- SSR for faster initial page loads
- Protected routes with authentication guards
- Nested layouts for consistent UI structure
- Efficient data fetching with loader functions


2.3 Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3.1 Token-Based Authentication
..............................................................................

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) - RFC 7519 Standard:
- Self-contained tokens with encoded claims
- Stateless authentication (no server-side session storage)
- Signature verification using HMAC or RSA
- Industry adoption: Google, Facebook, Microsoft

ADVANTAGES:
- Scalability (no session state)
- Cross-domain support (CORS-friendly)
- Mobile application friendly

DISADVANTAGES:
- Token size larger than session IDs
- Cannot revoke tokens before expiration
- Vulnerable if secret key compromised

SynergyOS Implementation:
- django-rest-framework-simplejwt library
- Access token: 60-minute lifetime
- Refresh token: 24-hour lifetime
- Token blacklisting on logout
- Automatic token rotation


2.3.2 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
..............................................................................

RBAC Model (Ferraiolo & Kuhn, 1992):
- Users assigned to roles
- Roles granted permissions
- Separation of duties principle

NIST RBAC Standard (2004) defines:
- Core RBAC: Users, Roles, Permissions, Sessions
- Hierarchical RBAC: Role inheritance
- Constrained RBAC: Separation of duty

SynergyOS RBAC Implementation:
- Project Owner: Full project control
- Team Member: Task management within assigned projects
- Permissions enforced at view level (IsProjectOwner)
- Django's built-in User and Permission models extended


2.4 Webhook Technology and Event-Driven Architecture
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.4.1 Webhook Fundamentals
..............................................................................

Webhooks introduced by Jeff Lindsay (2007):
- "Reverse APIs" or "HTTP callbacks"
- Server-to-server HTTP POST notifications
- Event-driven rather than polling-based

WEBHOOK BENEFITS:
- Real-time notifications
- Reduced server load (no polling)
- Loose coupling between systems
- Integration flexibility

WEBHOOK CHALLENGES:
- Delivery reliability
- Security (authentication/verification)
- Retry logic and failure handling
- Duplicate event handling


2.4.2 Existing Webhook Implementations
..............................................................................

GITHUB WEBHOOKS:
- Event types: push, pull_request, issues, etc.
- HMAC-SHA256 signature in X-Hub-Signature header
- Retry mechanism: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- Delivery status tracking

STRIPE WEBHOOKS:
- Payment and subscription events
- Webhook signature verification with timestamp
- Webhook endpoint testing with CLI tool
- Event history and replay functionality

SLACK WEBHOOKS:
- Incoming webhooks for posting messages
- Outgoing webhooks for event subscriptions
- Request verification with signing secret
- Scoped permissions per webhook

SYNERGYOS WEBHOOK SYSTEM:
Inspired by industry best practices:
- 12 event types (project, task, member, activity)
- HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Delivery tracking and statistics
- UUID-based webhook identification
- Per-webhook secret keys
- Celery-based asynchronous delivery


2.5 Asynchronous Task Processing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.5.1 Message Queue Systems
..............................................................................

RABBITMQ (Pivotal, 2007):
- Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)
- Complex routing capabilities
- High reliability with persistent queues
- Resource-intensive

REDIS (Salvatore Sanfilippo, 2009):
- In-memory data structure store
- Simple pub/sub messaging
- Lightweight and fast
- Limited persistence compared to RabbitMQ

APACHE KAFKA (LinkedIn, 2011):
- Distributed streaming platform
- High throughput for large-scale systems
- Complex setup and management
- Overkill for most web applications

SYNERGYOS CHOICE: Redis
- Dual purpose: caching + message broker
- Reduced infrastructure complexity
- Sufficient for typical web application scale
- django-redis integration for session storage


2.5.2 Celery Distributed Task Queue
..............................................................................

Celery (Ask Solem, 2009):
- Distributed task queue for Python
- Supports multiple message brokers (Redis, RabbitMQ)
- Task scheduling with Celery Beat
- Task result storage and retrieval

CELERY FEATURES USED IN SYNERGYOS:
- Asynchronous webhook delivery
- Scheduled cleanup tasks (expired webhooks)
- Email notification queuing
- Background data processing
- Task retry with exponential backoff

CELERY CONFIGURATION:
- Worker: Processes tasks from queue
- Beat: Scheduler for periodic tasks
- Result backend: Redis for task results
- JSON serialization for task arguments


2.6 Containerization and Deployment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.6.1 Docker Technology
..............................................................................

Docker (Solomon Hykes, 2013):
- Operating-system-level virtualization
- Lightweight compared to virtual machines
- Consistent environment across development and production
- Container orchestration with Docker Compose/Swarm/Kubernetes

BENEFITS FOR SYNERGYOS:

- One-command deployment

SYNERGYOS DOCKER ARCHITECTURE:
Services: PostgreSQL, Redis, Django Backend, Celery Worker, 
         Celery Beat, React Frontend, Nginx
Networks: Bridge network for inter-service communication
